                  Jamie Foxx has revealed an intervention from US talk show
                  queen Oprah Winfrey helped him get his life back on track.{" "}
                  <br /> <br />
                  The actor told DJ Howard Stern that Winfrey had rebuked his
                  "gallivanting" and had told him he was "blowing it". <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  Winfrey, Foxx went on, also arranged a meeting with Sidney
                  Poitier "to make me understand the significance" of being
                  nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br />
                  The meeting took place one week before the 2005 Oscars, where
                  Foxx won best actor for playing Ray Charles in Ray. <br />{" "}
                  <br />
                  Foxx, who was also nominated that year for the best supporting
                  actor Oscar, went on to star in Quentin Tarantino's western
                  Django Unchained. <br /> <br />
                  "You know me, I was going hard," the 49-year-old told Stern
                  this week during an appearance on the latter's radio show.
                  "I'm having such a good time, and I'm not knowing I'm
                  [expletive] up. I'm drinking, I'm doing every [expletive]
                  thing you can possibly imagine." "That's not what you want to
                  do," Foxx recalled Winfrey telling him in an unexpected phone
                  call. "I want to take you somewhere." This led to a visit to
                  Quincy Jones's house, where he was told by the legendary
                  producer: "You're doing good, man, we just don't want you to
                  blow it, baby."
