                Jamie Foxx has revealed an intervention from US talk show queen
                Oprah Winfrey helped him get his life back on track. <br />{" "}
                <br />
                The actor told DJ Howard Stern that Winfrey had rebuked his
                "gallivanting" and had told him he was "blowing it". <br />{" "}
                <br />
                Winfrey, Foxx went on, also arranged a meeting with Sidney
                Poitier "to make me understand the significance" of being
                nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br />
                The meeting took place one week before the 2005 Oscars, where
                Foxx won best actor for playing Ray Charles in Ray. <br />{" "}
                <br />
                Foxx, who was also nominated that year for the best supporting
                actor Oscar, went on to star in Quentin Tarantino's western
                Django Unchained. <br /> <br />
                "You know me, I was going hard," the 49-year-old told Stern this
                week during an appearance on the latter's radio show. "I'm
                having such a good time, and I'm not knowing I'm [expletive] up.
                I'm drinking, I'm doing every [expletive] thing you can possibly
                imagine." "That's not what you want to do," Foxx recalled
                Winfrey telling him in an unexpected phone call. "I want to take
                you somewhere." This led to a visit to Quincy Jones's house,
                where he was told by the legendary producer: "You're doing good,
                man, we just don't want you to blow it, baby." Winfrey, Foxx
